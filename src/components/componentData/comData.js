      "From the beginning of the iGEM competition day, various publications were made on our social networks in order to share with people our events, information on sponsorships received, awareness about EDCs and the use of plastics, as well as our activities. of human practices. We would consider this aspect as one of our strongest ones developed, due to the successful results observed. We wanted to reach more people external to the competition, with a specific focus on young ages. Surprisingly enough, our work was a wonderful success since we had a reach of 3,058 accounts, of which 685 had interactions. In order to measure this scope more precisely, our audience is mainly from Mexico but also from the United States, Indonesia and Germany, ages 18-34, where 56.7% are women and 43.2% are men.",

      "Even though our project focuses on EDCs and their effects on agriculture in Mexico, it is significant to provide information on the sciences to generate curiosity towards their study. That is why in our social networks we continually share news, curious facts and advances in science; In this way, both we and the general public remain informed and participate in an effective communication of science.",

We helped everyone practice their final presentation, get more used to speaking in English, justify their project, get a closer experience of how the Jamboree would be and also get important and useful feedback from the judges we organized.(#link collaborations).",

      "Thanks to the digitalization and globalization of the media, we have decided to carry out an awareness campaign in order to publicize what EDCs are, where they are located, how to prevent them from contaminating the environment and from reaching different organisms.However, a few videos on our social networks are not enough, despite the fact that they are a quick means of entertainment, we ourselves do not have enough reach in the short term, so it is necessary that more citizens and authorities are interested in the situation and create contact networks for cooperation and attack the problem from different points.",

      "We collaborated with the podcast of the Botanical Garden of the UNAM Institute of Biology, CIENCIANDO, in which we talked about what iGEM is, the competition and the project we are developing. It was a very nice experience because we were able to describe the hard work we have been doing throughout the year in a very entertaining and interesting way. On the other hand, we are very grateful to the Botanical Garden for having given us the space and access to a dissemination platform that has an approach that is very much in line with our project, in addition to the fact that the format and medium are among the most innovative in the present. We also plan to return to this institution after the Jamboree to continue sharing the results of our project, as well as continue inspiring more people to get involved in science, specifically synthetic biology.
