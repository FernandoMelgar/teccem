      "Initiating the design of the constructs in silico, team TecCEM designed and built constructs mixing existing parts and adding new ones to the registry (please see more at registry). Three main sets of parts were created: the Biosensor Parts, the Degradation Parts, and the Safety Project Parts. Referring to the Human Estrogen Receptor Alpha, RecA inteins (biosensor), Laccase TV and Laccase 15A (degradation) obtaining methodology was carried out as shown in the picture. Laccase 15A was retrieved from IGEM Plates, thus differs in steps 1-3, steps 2-9 were applied to hER alpha and both Laccases meanwhile, steps 8 and 9 were not necessary for RecA. For the results, please refer to the Results section. ",
