        <p className="p">It is important to mention that the implementation plan form TecCEM 2021 [1] inspired us to continue with the biosensor. It was decided to  keep on going with the fundamental purpose; detect and quantify EDCs. But this year Hydro-Defense decided to renovate each component and add things that were missing. Drawbacks from TecCEM 2021 are stated by them.</p>
