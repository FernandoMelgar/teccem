          Implementation biosensor
        </h1>
        <p className="p">
          <br />
          Our biosensor is a partial follow-up of our past year-team’s project,
          in relation to the aspect of identifying EDCs. As an improvement we
          wanted to detail even deeper and more specifically the fields of
          implementation of the biosensor. Our final work is planned to be
          applied into two main fields: Study and Environmental Assessment.
          Within these, we are making our biosensor versatile to serve as a
          measurement tool in laboratories for the wide variety of existing EDCs
          and different samples.
          <br />
          <br />
          We aim that our biosensor helps the creation and development of other
          similar measuring instruments from our starting prototype. <br />
          <br />
          - Proposed end users and usage
          <br />
          Our proposed users are mainly, but not exclusively, water quality
          companies, regulatory agencies, and research institutions. <br />
          We highly expect the biosensor to be implemented in the{" "}
          <strong>environmental quality regulation field</strong>, in which it
          is necessary to know and analyze the conditions and properties of the
          water that is used in irrigation samples. In this field, our proposed
          users are water quality companies, regulatory agencies and
          water-related industries, as well as companies that generate plastics.

            environmentally safe.
          </em>
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          On the other hand, our proposed users in the{" "}
          <strong>research field</strong> involve{" "}
          <strong>institutes and laboratories.</strong> From our experts'
          interviews a variety of professionals suggested a tool as our
          biosensor would facilitate the development of their investigations.
          For example;
          <br />
          <br />
          ● PhD. Edson Estrada; in the proof of concept of his degradation
          bioreactor.
          <br />
          ● PhD. Mauricio Rodríguez and PhD student Sergio Alberto in their
          prostate cancer associated with EDCs research.
          <br />
          <br />
          <em>
            → For these users the keywords are: economic, easy to use, durable
            and effective.
          </em>
          <br />
          <br />
          Although these two proposed end users could be far apart from each
          other, we envision them using our biosensor as a crucial tool to
          continue their studies on EDCs-water analysis related projects. <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          - Vision
          <br />
          <br />
          We believe that our biosensor is able to help solve relevant and
          global issues related to water quality-analysis. We consider that the
          quantification of EDCs is important because they act not only as
          contaminants for the marine environment and wildlife but also as
          nocive substances for the human genetic, metabolic and neurological
          health. According to one of our stakeholders, our bionsensor acts as a
          viable solution in water quality-testing companies as both an analysis
          tool and a correct check up and calibration of their machinery too.
          Nevertheless, awareness is needed, the government and our community
          have to be well informed about the problematic we are currently living
          in, a chore we decided to encompass, please see more at Human
          Practices. This with the objective of reaching regulatory agencies or
          an integration into the compulsory standard framework in our country:
          whether in the form of a NOM or NMX. With our biosensor we also hope
          to aid in the development of our national legislative framework for
          the regulation of emissions of EDCs.
          <br />
          <br />
          - Ease of use
          <br />
          <br />
          Our focus is on the development of hardware and software, with the aim
          of creating a more simple use in both the design and the user
          interface. Obtaining simplified and reliable data would ease the
          experience for the users while manipulating the biosensor with details
          such as bluetooth connection would reduce space and external
          specifications.
          <br />
          <br />
          The design was worked around attractive, friendly and suitable
          dimensions to accommodate the environment of our end users. As for the
          operation with the samples, initially, for the balance to measure the
          samples it was through the use of a chip focused on the creation of
          microfluidic "droplets". But the desired outcome was not met as well,
          it was a complicated operation for the user with this method. To meet
          the requirements, the design was changed to a rectangular amber glass
          chamber, due to the need for an airtight space for the sample, without
          sacrificing the practicality of the biosensor.
          <br />
          <br />
          - Challenges, development and technology
          <br />
          <br />
          Nowadays there is a lack of awareness on the presence of EDCs in
          everyday products and their effects on human health and on the
          environment. There are also not enough efficient detection systems,
          even though there are methods of sensing these chemicals such as
          High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and other
          electrochemical methods, they require specialized personnel.
          Considering that they are high cost solutions and they are mainly
          meant for qualitative analysis, not quantitative. <br />
          <br />
          The assembly of our biosensor may prove to be a complex task,
          requiring taking into account several environmental factors that
          affect the composition of the sample; though being a challenge, it
          allows for the synergy with other technologies in order to make up for
          the variability of the environmental factors, and the versatility of
          the biosensor. Through this the EDC sensing methods can be more
          efficient, less costly, quantifiable and more versatile.
          <br />
          <br />
          There are new fast development methods for particle detection, with
          more sensitive and specific capture methods. Important factors for us
          that help to make the technology more feasible for everyone as well
          for the development of more precise parts for the individual elements
          of our hardware.
          <br />
          <br />
          - Limitations
          <br />
          A main limitation is around its end objective, because to arrive at
          its main goal to work around legislative frameworks it is precisely
          necessary to collaborate with local governments. To learn more about
          how we are working to solve this issue visit our Human Practices tab.
          Though there are several bottlenecks around this problem, there are
          also workarounds: the mass production of the biosensor, though
          challenging and complex, it is not necessary if it is working around
          the right environment and the right usage, since it works with
          relative small samples for detection of EDCs.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          - Dual Use
          <br />
          One of our greatest concerns within our project is tackling issues
          surrounding our technology through biosafety and biosecurity. Dual-use
          consists of carrying out a biological research aiming for some
          specific scientific purpose, but taking into account that the results
          could also be encompassed with misused practices and activities to
          pose a biological threat to the world population.
          <br />
          <br />
          1) Biosafety
          <br />
          <br />
          In terms of biosafety, the immobilization of our biosensor avoids the
          interaction with the environment, and prevents it from going into the
          samples run through the biosensor. Our recombinant protein would be
          inside a chamber, avoiding its release. In the case of accidental
          interaction with the environment through misuse or other means, our
          biosensor, being eco-friendly, does not harm or affect the environment
          nor living organisms. <br />
          <br />
          2) Biosecurity <br />
          <br />
          The right usage of any biological and chemical materials is critical
          to ensure the biosecurity, thus, through the development of our
          biosensor, the team made use of good practices to avoid accidental
          exposure to any harmful agents, such as proper sterilization
          techniques, chemical inactivation of biological materials and the
          usage and sterilization of gloves. <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          - What are the safety aspects you would need to consider?
          <br />
          The usage of an immobilized receptor protein ensures that it will not
          get transferred into the sample run, avoiding its release to the
          environment. Therefore it can be said that our protein shows safety
          aspects needed to be considered.

        <p className="p">
          <br />
          Our end goal is to have a beneficial impact on the problem of EDCs, so
          based on the conditions in which farmers work we have designed an end
          product. Here we have the final product: a small, simple to use
          packing with our immobilized laccase to help curve the problem of
          EDCs. During our investigation, we found that in Mexico the principal
          way of irritigatings crops is through gravity or flood irrigation,
          with a National average of 74.9% [1]. Irrigation by flooding is done
          with channels or furrows throughout the planting area, which are
          connected to a pond, river, well or any other water body. [2] In
          Mexico most of the water used for irrigation is not treated, around
          54% [3], and as it was previously established this water gets
          contaminated from several domestic and industrial sources, for
          example: treatment plants, effluents from hospitals, chemicals used in
          agricultural activities and livestock, septic tanks and others [3].
          All of these are sources of EDCs leading to the water having the
          presence of these substances. With this information, a great moment of
          action is working on the water farmers use to irrigate their crops, to
          reduce the amount of EDCs present in the food we consume, as well to
          avoid further contamination of the soil and groundwaters. [LINK A
          PROJECT DESCRIPTION]
          <br />
          <br />
          From the information we gathered from our stakeholders and our
          research; agriculture in Mexico represents an important work force
          with 5.5 million workers, but they also represent around 21.6% of the
          poorest people in the country. [4] With this in mind, any
          implementation has to be low in cost and also considering the
          principal way of irrigation (flood irrigation); it is also necessary
          to be simple in design to propose a solution.
          <br />
          Arriving at that solution wasn't an easy task. During our design
          stages we went through a lot of different options and prototypes;
          always adapting it to the needs and reality of our stakeholders,
          because in some cases, even a water pump (which is a common hardware
          on agriculture) can be inaccessible for mexican farmers. When we
          adopted laccase to be our principal agent for the solution we began to
          think about how to implement it outside the laboratory. The first
          implementation was related to a filtering membrane with the laccases.
          After improvements were done to the laccase by immobilizing it on
          zeolites, we chose a new irrigation system on sprinkler systems with a
          hard case that had the immobilized enzymes with zeolites. This
          proposal was abandoned because of the necessity of more time for
          degradation and because an irrigation system like sprinklers is far
          from the reality that farmers use in Mexico. To provide the necessary
          conditions for the laccase to work the third design was related to a
          mixing tank to provide a more efficient enzymatic activity, but this
          implementation was also far from the reality and possibilities of
          mexican farmers because of the high costs this hardware would require.
          Finally we arrive at our current implementation, a small packing that
          contains the immobilized enzyme as powder. This provides the simplest
          use for farmers and cheapest. <br />
          <br />
          [implementationproposed.png]
          <br />
          <br />
          With our project, agriculture related personnel will have a tool to
          help curve in a positive way the problematic: reducing EDCs
          concentration in water and stopping crop contamination but also aiding
          the economy of the most vulnerable people. Considering the various
          conditions on which agricultural workers deal with, such as
          contaminated water or with dangerous compounds, lack of
          infrastructure, inaccessibility to electricity, far rural areas, among
          others; it's necessary to be adaptable to all locations, and an easy
          to use tool. Inside the lab it may be convenient for us to have a
          sophisticated device in which the laccases will be more functional,
          but based on the information obtained from farmers, the presentation
          we give is the way to go. <br />
          Keywords reached from stakeholders we are implementing: Economic
          viability, user-friendly, environmentally friendly and human safe.{" "}
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          - Ease of use <br />
          In terms of methodology of use it's quite simple; the package with the
          immobilized laccase and zeolite powder will be opened; and its content
          will be poured into the water source they will use. After that it will
          be necessary to just wait for the laccases to do their work,
          approximately a 48 hour work space. The 48 hour mark is based upon our
          results of degradation. [Visit Degradation Results]. <br />
          It doesn't require any prior knowledge or capacitation to be able to
          use this powder. <br />
          <br />
          - Development
          <br />
          The use of this technology is very advantageous because it has an
          increasing rate of development. <br />
          The use of zeolite for pollutant removal and water treatment has been
          on the rise, with nearly 47% of the 9055 total researches published
          from 2013 to 2021 in the field of removal studies being related to
          zeolite, and with every passing year these numbers increase further.{" "}
          <br />
          Zeolites by themselves are beneficial for plants having effects of
          improving photosynthesis because of their capacity to absorb CO2 ,
          they also aid in the reduction of transpiration rates which improves
          the water-use efficiency. [5] <br />
          The use of laccase is very common in the degradation of EDCs, but many
          studies have noticed that the accuracy of using only laccase is very
          poor and time-consuming, because of that, the decision for combining a
          modified recombinant laccase and nanotechnology tools, was made by
          TecCEM.
          <br />
          The development of this technology is rapidly increasing based on the
          available research and experts. To know this we had a meeting with
          Engineer Edson Estrada Arriaga, an expert on water treatment with EDCs
          in Mexico, who pointed out that is a common occurrence of research and
          development of new technologies to make water drinkable, even by
          CONAGUA (National Water Commission) and by some enterprises; where
          this steps help on the long run to solve the problem. <br />
          <br />
          - Limitations <br />
          There is an important factor to improve to give the most efficient use
          to the product. The velocity of reaction is a property of the laccase
          that leads to the efficiency of the degradation. With the current
          product improvements in the time of degradation can be obtained with
          other cofactors, but more research is needed in that field. Plus, we
          chose to go for the “easy to use'' factor over “time efficiency”
          because of the awareness of agriculture's economic position. <br />
          <br />
          - Further steps
          <br />
          We are currently trying to delimit in which moment of irrigation to
          implement our powder with the immobilized laccase. We identify two
          possibilities: adding the powder onto the main waterbody or pond the
          farmer uses prior to irrigation, or adding the powder onto the
          channels where the water flows to flood the plants. <br />
          The advantages of adding the powder to the main waterbody or pond is
          that the immobilized enzyme will have the maximum time to develop any
          enzymatic activity, but there are some major drawbacks such as: <br />
          <br />
          - It is unknown for us how the immobilized enzyme will behave on large
          bodies of water. We don't know if the enzyme will rest at the surface
          or it will stagnate at the bottom.
          <br />
          <br />
          - It is unknown where EDCs rest in stagnant water bodies. We couldn't
          obtain enough information related to whether EDCs rest at the surface
          or at the bottom in large water bodies. This is important to know if
          our immobilized enzyme will be able to interact with EDCs in the same
          location. A useful study would be to measure the concentration of EDCs
          in water bodies at different depths to know where they’re more
          concentrated. <br />
          <br />
          Regarding the other proposal of adding the powder on the channels,
          some of the advantages would be the proximity to the plants where is
          our location of interest for the enzyme to work on. Also the zeolite
          would have the maximum potential of eliminating other compounds and
          giving beneficial properties to the plant as explored before. But
          there are some mechanisms in which we don't have enough information
          about. With the knowledge that EDCs can seep underground to reach
          groundwater we can hypothesize that our immobilized enzyme could
          follow the same route. We can also hypothesize that the humidity of
          the soil and the constant irrigation (or flooding) could act like
          resuspending the enzyme to allow it to keep degrading. A useful
          experiment would be to add EDCs on soil and add the powder with the
          immobilized enzyme and observe if the constant irrigation like the
          ones used on irrigation by flooding has any beneficial effect on the
          enzymatic activity. <br />
          To confirm any of these hypotheses is necessary to develop the
          experimentals and research to make any conclusions.
          <br />
          <br />
          [endpointimplementation.png]
          <br />
          <br />
          - Production and delivery <br />
          As a final product, the immobilized enzyme is in powder form, the user
          will be given an envelope containing the necessary amount of
          immobilized enzyme to perform the degradation.
          <br />
          The needed amounts for implementation outside the lab couldn't be
          obtained because our results ended up being inconsistent. [Visit
          Degradation Results] Also we couldn't give out an amount of necessary
          immobilized enzymes because our concentrations obtained from our
          results were not the most consistent. Also because of time it wasn't
          possible to develop an essay with the immobilized enzyme with
          zeolites, so its concentration to degrade on a certain volume of water
          is unknown, but this would be a great experiment for the future.{" "}
          <br />
          But a great aspect is that for seeing results it's not necessary a
          large scale production to implement the product. The amount of
          immobilized enzyme for the given volume of water is low. And these
          quantities are related in a directly proportional way.
          <br />
          The cost-effectiveness for water treatment depends on the price of
          commercially available products and the nanotechnology tools used for
          the immobilization. <br />

          - Dual Use
          <br />
          Biosecurity and biosafety are our main concerns when working in a lab
          and taking our work to the real world. <br />
          <br />
          1) Biosafety <br />
          In terms of biosafety, no special equipment for safety is necessary
          inside the lab or during production but the lab coat as in any
          laboratory. <br />
          There are no known side effects or allergic reactions to the use of
          laccase from Trametes versicolor. <br />
          Also no special waste treatments are needed, but waste material must
          be disposed of in accordance with national protocols. <br />
          <br />
          2) Biosecurity <br />
          With biosecurity related; any misuse or intentional release wouldn't
          cause any harm to the environment, users, crops or water. <br />
          The laccase used is recombinantly synthesized using E. coli DH5A BL21
          and HMS 174 strains. Therefore, ingestion by humans could cause
          stomach upset. However, apart from ingestion or contact with the nose
          or eyes, it is a safe product for humans and other living organisms.
          As well, the zeolite wouldn't cause any harm as there are established
          methods for wastewater treatment with zeolite, which removes heavy
          metals from the water, and a wide variety of toxic compounds. It can
          also be added that zeolite doesn't break down over time but improves
          nutrient retention, significantly reducing water and fertilizer costs
          by retaining nutrients in the root zone. [6]
          <br />
          <br />● Mutations with the laccase can be ruled out considering that
          the enzyme is already immobilized. <br />
          <br />● Autonomous release can also be ruled out because the proteins
          are unable to spread. Although as we presented in our results and
          research, the immobilized enzyme can be washed with the water current;
          but the free enzyme being washed around the soil wouldnt represent any
          risk to the environment. <br />
          <br />● The thing that can happen to the enzyme is denaturalization
          because of pH; where the ideal pH for our laccase is from 4.5 to 8.
          The enzyme is not functional under extreme conditions. The pH range
          where the laccase is functional is also correlated to the pH
          conditions present on untreated water. <br />
          <br />
          No options for preventing or stopping attacks related to an
          intentional harmful use of the product is needed, because by its own
          means it can’t cause any harm.
