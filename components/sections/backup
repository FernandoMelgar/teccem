                        <p className="mt-6 text-gray-600">Our main focus is Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs), a
                            concern that will only worsen with the passing of time. This problem was approached by our
                            past team (iGEM TecCEM 2021) and we still believe in the necessity of obtaining practical
                            solutions, thus we are working this year around improving the past work but also going
                            further by proposing a practical solution. But what are EDCs and why is it problematic? </p>

                    <p className="mt-6 text-gray-600">
                        An EDC (Endocrine Disrupting Chemical) are substances present in the environment; anywhere from
                        the soil to the air we breathe and even in the water we drink and the food we eat.
                        According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency an EDC is: “an exogenous agent that
                        interferes with synthesis, secretion, transport, metabolism, binding action, or elimination of
                        natural blood-borne hormones that are present in the body and are responsible for homeostasis,
                        reproduction, and developmental process.”[1]
                    </p>
                    <p className="mt-4 font-bold">
                        In short EDCs can interfere with endocrine or hormonal systems.

                            With the past definition it might be easy to comprehend why they are negative for us, but we
                            can
                            go further in.
                            EDCs interfere with the body's natural hormone system. It can go as far as acting like a
                            “hormone mimic”, leading the body to believe they are hormones, allowing them (EDCs) to
                            block
                            the natural work of hormones. Some can increase or decrease the total amount of hormones in
                            our
                            bloodstream, affecting how they are produced, synthesized and even stored up in our body.
                            [2]
                            Because of its capacity to modify the normal hormonal activity it can lead to consequences
                            such
                            as: alterations in sperm quality and fertility, abnormalities in sex organs, endometriosis,
                            early puberty, altered nervous system function, immune function, certain cancers,
                            respiratory
                            problems, metabolic issues, diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular problems, growth, neurological
                            and
                            learning disabilities, and more. [2]

                    <p className="mt-6 font-bold">
                        EDC’s can have many different sources such as:</p>
                    <ul className="list-disc ml-5 mt-2">
                        <li>
                            Industrial waste can lead to major contamination into soil and groundwater with
                            industrial chemicals. Also much of this chemical waste can end up in wastewater. This
                            can create a great chain of contamination making its way through our food chain, from
                            fish, animals or crops that were in contact with such contamination chains. [3]
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Common consumer products contain EDC’s or are packaged in containers which can be sources of
                            EDC’s. Some examples are household products, fabrics for clothing, fabrics treated with
                            flame retardants, cosmetics, lotions, products with fragrances, soaps, anti-bacterials,
                            cleaning products, among others Processed foods can accumulate EDC’s from its manufacturing,
                            packing, transportation or storage. [2]
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            From discarded drugs into wastewater. The most common are metformin, which is for type II
                            diabetes, and carbamazepine.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            There can be “natural” EDC’s coming from plants or humans such as estrogen excretion or
                            another example are Soy-based products contain phytoestrogens, which are chemicals produced
                            by plants that mimic estrogen. [2]
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Also present in household construction materials or furniture finding its way through
                            household dust. [2]
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Pesticides, fungicides and herbicides are common sources of EDC’s that lead to the
                            contamination of crops.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p className="mt-6">
                        This exposure can occur with the presente products, through drinking contaminated water,
                        breathing contaminated air, ingesting food, or contacting contaminated soil.
                        Agricultural workers are at great risk of developing a reproductive or endocrine abnormality
                        because of their close contact with EDC’s from pesticides, fungicides, industrial chemicals and
                        wastewater. This past relation also leads to the contamination of crops consumed by humans and
                        animals to receive these chemicals. [3]
                    </p>

                    <p className="mt-2">
                        Another problematic factor is related to EDC’s half life, which for industrial convenience they
                        were designed to have long half lives, but after many decades these substances are still
                        present, mainly because they can’t be easily metabolized or in some occasions they are broken
                        down into more toxic compounds than the original molecule. Some substances that were banned
                        decades ago are still present in the environment in high concentrations. [3]
